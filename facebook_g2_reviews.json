    "body": "5/5What do you like best about Facebook?Since its inception in 2004 created a great change to meet other people from our same city or a different country, just by searching for a person’s username, which makes it very easy to talk to someone without having to exchange phone numbers or emails, and makes informal conversations more comfortable, is an application that I use very often easily 1 or 2 hours updating me with my contacts. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Facebook?The only thing I don’t like about Facebook, is about users using the platform to do bad things like scams or send obscene photos, although with blocking the user or making a post that situation usually eliminates the problem completely, and at the same time protects other users from going through that bad time. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Facebook solving and how is that benefiting you?There are problems that Facebook has given a very efficient solution, such as being able to sell items or products by marketplace and thus earn a profit from an old membership, and another solution that I like much more is the possibility of generating advertising revenue by Adsense uploading own videos, content that we like to produce and people see, share, react and leave personal opinions that are always enjoyed to read.
