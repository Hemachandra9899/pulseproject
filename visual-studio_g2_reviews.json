    "body": "4.5/5What do you like best about Visual Studio?Visual Studio makes coding much easier with its smart IntelliSense feature. It automatically suggests code, helps find errors quickly, and supports many programming languages.\n I've been using Visual Studio from last 2 years, and its extensions make it the best for coding. You can easily add tools that suit your development needs. The reusability of code becomes easier, and it shows errors in real-time, which saves a lot of debugging time. The best part is that you can do everything — from frontend coding to backend development and even database management — all in one place. It's a complete full-stack solution for developers. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Visual Studio?The startup time is often slow, especially when multiple extensions are installed. The unpaid version of Blackbox isn’t very effective and lacks many useful features. Also, sometimes two different extensions conflict with each other, causing functionality issues.\nAlso, multiple windows and tabs often make it complex to use, especially when creating or managing new files. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Visual Studio solving and how is that benefiting you?Visual Studio solves the problem of managing a full-stack development workflow by bringing everything into one clean, powerful interface. From writing frontend code to building complex Django-based backend systems, I can handle everything in one place.Its support for GitHub makes version control incredibly easy — I can clone repos, manage branches, commit, push, pull, and even resolve merge conflicts directly within the IDE. This integration saves me from constantly switching to terminal or external Git tools.\nThe best part is: I don't need to juggle multiple apps. From writing code to debugging to GitHub collaboration — everything is smooth, fast, and productive. It's a huge time-saver and makes development much more professional and enjoyable.

Every language have different plugin as per developer need. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Visual Studio?1. Complex to change theme, Font, Style. I think they can give one section in left or right side and provide all important settings on that so user can easily navigate and change any setting easily currently its to complex.\n2. They can provide option to add git account from left side git section so user can easily add account.\n3. In git section they can provide more options icons like cherrt pick or create patches. So as per developer its easy and easly use that functionality Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Visual Studio solving and how is that benefiting you?1.

    "title": "\"Best IDE in the market for most tech stack, although getting behind on AI driven development.\"",
    "body": "4.5/5What do you like best about Visual Studio?I'm a software dev and VSCode has become an indispensable part of my workflow. What I like most? everything. Its ability to handle large projects with countless files while maintaining exceptional performance. The editor remains responsive, even when working on monolith projects with complex dependencies or giant codebases. The mini-map is nice, so if you have been a fan of Sublime then you won't be lost. Also, with the seamless integration of keyboard shortcuts, you can become incredibly efficient by never lifting fingers from your keyboard.\n\nBut truly, what I like most about VSCode is that there seems to be an extension for everything, you can customize your environment tailored to your every need. Extensions like GitLens make version control straightforward by providing visual indicators for changes, commit history, and author insights. AI tools, such as Copilot, take productivity to another level by suggesting code snippets and solutions as you type, or AmazonQ help integrate cloud-specific solutions, and code generators. But also, there is a small extension for any productivity improvement you can imagine, few things I have installed: a color picker while coding CSS, a live preview for frontend projects, batch file renames, char count, and also several code snippets and boilerplate generators for HTML, Ruby, Python, etc. I have seach and found even a SUM extension for selected numbers on a file... \n\nFinally, one thing I really like about VSCode is how it works with modern frameworks and technologies. It provides excellent support for building apps with Flutter, React, and Ionic, among many others. From setting up a project to debugging and testing, I can control everything directly from the editor. Whether it’s running a Flutter emulator, managing a React build process, or deploying an Ionic app, VSCode handles it all seamlessly.\nIts integrated a terminal, debugger, and task runner.\n\nSummary, it is a powerhouse for developers, and you will enjoy working on your products. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Visual Studio?I've been testing latetly the AI Copilot extensions and all Copilot recent releases for VSCode. I would had loved if it was fully integrated with the IDE, currently only supports the file you have openned, Copilot will give you great code completitions suggestions, but it lacks context on your entire openned project. At this point developers are moving towars an AI asisted development environment, so IDEs such as Cursor and Windsurf that are actually based on VSCode are having such a great adoption and a huge advantage than VSCode Today. Although I think VSCode is moving to the right direction, I think it is moving slowly considering Copilot is also from Microsoft.\n\nI love how you can extend VSCode and pretty much customize it for your preferable development environment, it is a manual that by now it should have been part of a sign up onBoarding wizard, the IDE asking you what tech stack you use and/or pick it automatically from your openned project and automatically install the extensions you need. It lacks that level of sofisticated recommendation. And, if you check the actual Recommended Extensions most cases are not even close to what we need on a project. Definitely I do not like how the actual Extensions recommendations works.\n\nOne other thing I don't like much is how complex configurations are required for native mobile developmebt, I would still recommend Xcode and Android Studio for native Swift and Kotlin. Example, for native development you don't have yet a way to build the apps and run infrom on the simulator directly from VSCode. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Visual Studio solving and how is that benefiting you?It simplifies development, version control and debugging. With built-in tools and extensions like GitLens and Copilot it boosts productivity and allows writing code and deploying apps—in one single integrated environment.\nWe use it for app development projects such as Backend projects with Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, or PHP as well as Frontend with ReactJs, Vue, Angular, and mobile projects such as Flutter or React Native projects, using the extensions for each of those tech stack helps me and our developers to perform better.
